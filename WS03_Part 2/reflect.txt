professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The workshop focused on creating and manipulating objects of a class, encapsulation, and proper code organization. Here are some key takeaways:
Encapsulation: I've learned the importance of encapsulating data within a class and controlling access through member functions. This ensures data integrity and allows for better code maintenance.

Constructor and Destructor: I've practiced implementing constructors to initialize class objects and destructors to release allocated resources, like dynamic memory. It's crucial to manage resources properly to prevent memory leaks.

Member Functions: I've used member functions to perform various operations on class objects. These functions encapsulate the behavior associated with the class and promote code reusability.

Testing: I've gained experience in writing test cases to verify the correctness of class methods and ensure that they meet the specified requirements.

Overall, this workshop has deepened my understanding of OOP principles in C++,It has also enhanced my skills in writing well-structured and error-resilient code, which are essential for developing reliable software applications.
